`git clone https://github.com/jose-techcode/BOT_Luamod`

# 6. Project Folder

- Bash

`cd BOT_Luamod`

# 7. Install Dependencies

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# 8. Setting Environment Variables

Create a file called .env in the project root and add your bot token:

`DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token`

In the same .env file, if you're creating specific commands for only the bot developer to use, add:

`DEV_ID=your_id`

Also, in the same .env file, if you're creating specific commands for using the bot's AI, add:

`API_KEY_OPEN_ROUTER=your_api_key`

These files should not be uploaded to Github, as they contain sensitive information. Therefore, they should be included in .gitignore.
